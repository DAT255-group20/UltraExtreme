UltraExtreme
============

## Developer

Instructions on how to import the project and the test project into Eclipse can be found in
![doc/Developer Manual.pdf](https://github.com/DAT255-group20/UltraExtreme/blob/develop/doc/Developer%20Manual.pdf).
In that document are also instructions on some settings you will probably **need to change in Eclipse to be able to
compile the project and run the tests**.
